# DGA Intel

Using deep learning to detect DGA domains.

# Overview
The DGAIntel Python module allows you to utilize a powerful CNN-LSTM model to predict whether a given domain name was generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA) or corresponds to a genuine domain. The prediction features are also accesible through [this website](http://www.dgaintel.com/), but this package allows for direct integration into your workflow.

# Usage

Here, we will go through using DGA Intel.

## Requirements

DGAIntel is designed for use with Python 3 only. It has only two requirements:

    - TensorFlow
    - Numpy
